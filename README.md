# Linear Regression Methods Repository

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing various approaches to Linear Regression in Python. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. This repository is structured into four sub-folders, each focusing on a specific method of implementing Linear Regression.

## 1. Simple Linear Regression From Scratch 
This folder contains an implementation of Simple Linear Regression using a custom function. The primary goal of this method is to provide a clear understanding of the underlying mathematical equations governing Simple Linear Regression. The dataset used for this implementation is `Salary_dataset.csv`.

### Code Details

The code in this folder showcases the following:
- Calculation of regression coefficients using closed-form solutions.
- - Plotting the cost function and minimizing it using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
- Visualization of the best-fit line using matplotlib.
- No reliance on external library functions for Linear Regression.
- 
## 2. Simple Linear Regression Using Function

This folder presents an alternative approach to Simple Linear Regression from the first folder. Similar to the previous method, it utilizes the `Salary_dataset.csv` file.

### Code Details

The code here differs in structure and approach compared to the function-based implementation. It includes:
- Iterative optimization for regression coefficients.
- Step-by-step implementation of mathematical equations.

## 3. Multiple Linear Regression Using Function

Moving beyond Simple Linear Regression, this folder introduces Multiple Linear Regression using a custom function. The dataset used for this method is `winequality-red.csv`.

### Code Details

This implementation builds upon the concepts from Simple Linear Regression, extending them to multiple independent variables. Key features include:
- A function for best-fitting the line in multiple dimensions.
- Visualization of results with 3D plotting.

## 4. Multiple Linear Regression From Scratch

In this folder, we delve into an alternative implementation of Multiple Linear Regression from scratch, utilizing the same `winequality-red.csv` dataset.

### Code Details

The code provides a detailed walkthrough of:
- Implementation of mathematical equations for Multiple Linear Regression.
- No reliance on external library functions for the complete process.
- Minimizing the cost function using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
- Visualization of the final best-fitted plane in 3D.

# Simple-Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
This repository provides a detailed implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python. The code goes step by step through the mathematical aspects of simple linear regression, making it an excellent learning tool for those who want a thorough grasp of the algorithm.

# Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a basic statistical technique to model the relationship between two variables. In this case, we're exploring how the years of experience (independent variable) relate to an individual's salary (dependent variable). What's special about this repository is that we've built the entire regression model "from scratch," meaning we've written the code ourselves without relying on external libraries.

# What Does it Include?

## Mathematical Insights: 
Dive into the fundamental mathematical concepts behind Simple Linear Regression. The code includes clear implementations of equations like the cost function, gradient descent, and the linear regression hypothesis.

## Dataset Exploration: 
Get familiar with the dataset used in this project, containing two essential columns: YearsExperience and Salary.

## Model Training: 
Follow the steps in the simple_linear_regression.py script to see how we train the model using gradient descent, a crucial optimization algorithm in machine learning.

## Visualization: 
Check out the visualizations created by the code, showing the regression line fitted to the data points, helping you understand how the model makes predictions.

# Whay You'll Learn?
This repository serves as a very useful resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Linear Regression. By going through the code, you'll not only implement a regression model from scratch but also grasp the mathematical equations that are involved in this widely used algorithm.
