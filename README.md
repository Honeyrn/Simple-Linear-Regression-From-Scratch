# Simple-Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
This repository provides a detailed implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python. The code goes step by step through the mathematical aspects of simple linear regression, making it an excellent learning tool for those who want a thorough grasp of the algorithm.

# Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a basic statistical technique to model the relationship between two variables. In this case, we're exploring how the years of experience (independent variable) relate to an individual's salary (dependent variable). What's special about this repository is that we've built the entire regression model "from scratch," meaning we've written the code ourselves without relying on external libraries.

# What Does it Include?

## Mathematical Insights: 
Dive into the fundamental mathematical concepts behind Simple Linear Regression. The code includes clear implementations of equations like the cost function, gradient descent, and the linear regression hypothesis.

## Dataset Exploration: 
Get familiar with the dataset used in this project, containing two essential columns: YearsExperience and Salary.

## Model Training: 
Follow the steps in the simple_linear_regression.py script to see how we train the model using gradient descent, a crucial optimization algorithm in machine learning.

## Visualization: 
Check out the visualizations created by the code, showing the regression line fitted to the data points, helping you understand how the model makes predictions.

# Whay You'll Learn?
This repository serves as a very useful resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Linear Regression. By going through the code, you'll not only implement a regression model from scratch but also grasp the mathematical equations that are involved in this widely used algorithm.
